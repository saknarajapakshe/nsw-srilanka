# Migrate builder – builds the standalone migrator from nsw-agency.
# It lives in a separate module, so we fetch it at a pinned pseudo-version
# inside a throwaway module rather than adding it to this repo's go.mod. CGO is
# disabled: the tool imports go-sqlite3, but we only drive postgres (pure-Go
# pgx), so sqlite stays an unused runtime stub. We use `go build -o` rather than
# `go install`, because `go install` refuses to write the binary when
# cross-compiling for a non-host GOOS/GOARCH (multi-arch buildx).

# Built explicitly via `--target migrate`; `runtime` is kept LAST so a
# bare `docker build .` (and any consumer without an explicit target)
# resolves to the server image, not the migrator.
